# MyBB Disposable Email Blacklist (Updated - 2020)
MyBB Plugin which blocks 7831 known anonymous, disposable, or spam email providers or services.

Originally created by Depressurize and updated by Stardust342, I have merged both plugins into one and used martensons git (https://github.com/martenson/disposable-email-domains) as update source.
